                <p class="fs-6 fw-medium mb-4">We’re a young and passionate team of readers, dreamers, and lifelong
                    learners who believe that books are more than just paper and ink — they’re gateways to new ideas,
                    emotions, and possibilities.</p>
                <br class="mb-4">We started small — just a few titles, a few clicks, and a lot of heart.
                Today, we’re growing fast, fueled by curiosity, creativity, and the love of good books.<br />
                Whether you're into thrillers, self-help, romance, or academic reads, we’re here to help
                you discover books that move you, challenge you, and make you think.<br />
                This is just the beginning. And we’re so excited to have you on this journey with us.</p>

                    <p>We’re a young and newly launched online bookstore, with a simple goal:

                        to make books easier to discover and more exciting to read.<br />
                        Based in Viet Name, we are a young startup with big dreams — combining love for literature with
                        the power of technology to create a smarter, smoother, and more enjoyable book-buying
                        experience. <br />
                        While we may be small now, we’re growing fast — one happy reader at a time.

                        Driven by curiosity, powered by innovation, and inspired by our community, we are here to
                        reimagine what a modern bookstore can be.</p>
